#webdev #mern #react #websockets

Efficient attendance tracking is vital for any organization. In our latest project, we developed a Real-Time Attendance Management System that improves the user experience with live updates, automated notifications, and reminders—powered entirely by WebSockets.

Core Features

✅ Instant Attendance Updates with WebSockets
By leveraging WebSockets, the system instantly updates attendance records across all connected devices. Whenever an employee marks their attendance, the change is immediately visible—no page refresh required.

🔔 Automated Reminders & Notifications
To help users stay on schedule, we implemented smart reminders. The system sends real-time alerts via WebSockets for check-ins and check-outs, ensuring compliance without manual follow-ups.

🏢 Role-Based Permissions
Administrators can track attendance in real time, analyze data, and send alerts, while employees have access to their personal attendance logs in a simple and intuitive interface.

💾 Robust & Scalable Backend
Our backend, built with Express.js, follows best practices for modularity and maintainability. WebSockets are integrated with Redis Pub/Sub, enabling scalable real-time communication across multiple servers.
